# TheaterConnect
TheaterConnect: An app that connects artists with audition opportunities, showcases scripts for review, and uses AR to visualize and purchase props and costumes, built with Flutter, Firebase, and ModelViewer.
### Inspiration
Many artists are often unaware of audition opportunities and consequently miss out. Directors, on the other hand, face challenges in discovering new talent. Additionally, setting the stage and searching for props can be cumbersome. My app aims to solve these issues using augmented reality (AR). I devised an app to assist in resolving these challenges.

### What it does
- **Displays Audition Information:** The app showcases all available audition details for performers.
- **Advertising Auditions:** Playwrights can advertise their auditions on this platform.
- **Script and Play Postings:** Rookie scriptwriters and playwrights can post their screenplays for others to review, giving them opportunities to direct plays.
- **Buying Props:** Users can buy props and costumes. Before purchasing, they can visualize these items using AR on their phones.

### How I built it
I developed the app using Flutter for the frontend, Firebase for the backend, and ModelViewer for the AR functionalities.

### Challenges I ran into
- **Git Collaboration:** Initially, I wasn't comfortable using Git, making collaboration on the same repository difficult.
- **Firebase Learning Curve:** As Firebase was new to me, I spent considerable time understanding the documentation and coding a functional backend.
- **3D Models:** Finding suitable 3D models that could run using ModelViewer was challenging.
- **Flutter Package Errors:** I encountered issues with package errors due to different versions of Flutter.
- **Filtering Auditions by Location:** Implementing location-based filtering for auditions proved to be difficult and remains unresolved.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I successfully created a fully functional app with a working backend and integrated AR models.

### What I learned
- **Firebase Integration:** I learned how to integrate a Firebase project into a Flutter app.
- **Firestore Database:** I gained experience working with the Firestore database.
- **User Authentication:** I implemented user authentication using Firebase.
- **AR Features:** I learned to implement AR features in a Flutter app using ModelViewer.
- **ModelViewer Libraries:** I became familiar with key libraries in the ModelViewer package.
- **Git Proficiency:** I understood the importance of branching, resolving merge conflicts, and moved on from directly uploading files to using the Git command line.

### What's next for TheaterConnect
- **Location-Based Audition Filtering:** I plan to add a feature that filters auditions based on location.
- **Motivational Videos:** Adding short videos where artists can upload content to motivate each other.
- **Educational Content:** Including educational videos to help newcomers learn more about the industry.
- **Expanded AR Models:** I aim to add more AR models for better visualization of prop placement on stage and costumes.
